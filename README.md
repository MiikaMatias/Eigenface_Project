# Project basics
This project is my attempt to understand the eigenface face-recogntion algorithm as a 1st year computer science student. It uses the Yale-faces dataset
and some features from the numpy/PIL libraries, but primarily all of the datastructures are written from the ground up. The general goal for this
project was always to build a face recognition system from first principles, and while I had to cut some corners due to time constraints, I largely
succeeded at this.
