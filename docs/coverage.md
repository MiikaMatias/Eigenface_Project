# Test coverage Report
1) [matrix_test.py covers 92% of matrix.py](https://github.com/MiikaMatias/Eigenface_Project/blob/main/docs/test_reports/index_matrix.html)
2) [vector_test.py covers 85% of vector.py](https://github.com/MiikaMatias/Eigenface_Project/blob/main/docs/test_reports/index_vector.html)
3) [operations_test.py covers 84% of operations.py](https://github.com/MiikaMatias/Eigenface_Project/blob/main/docs/test_reports/index_operations.html)

# Rationale
The reason for these occasionally low coverage ratings is that a majority of them merely concern error messages, or other small code bits not central to the running of the program.
